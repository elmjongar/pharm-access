# Rx-iled: Where the Pharmacies Aren’t ## Identifying Pharmacy Deserts in Washington, DC## Purpose of the AnalysisThis project aims to identify gaps in pharmacy access across Washington, DC. Pharmacy deserts, or places where people must travel more than a mile to reach a pharmacy in urban areas, can make it harder for residents to get the prescriptions and health resources they need. By mapping and analyzing these areas, this project aims to highlight where pharmacy access is limited.## Background The term pharmacy desert was first introduced in 2014 by researcher Dr. Dima M. Qato in a study published in Health Affairs titled "Pharmacy Deserts Are Prevalent In Chicago’s Predominantly Minority Communities, Raising Medication Access Concerns," which explored pharmacy access in Chicago. “Pharmacy deserts” refers to areas where people lack convenient access to pharmacies. This can have a detrimental impact on low-income, elderly, and chronically ill individuals who depend on pharmacies for prescriptions and basic health services. In urban areas, a pharmacy desert can be identified as an area where residents live more than one mile from the nearest pharmacy.  Mapping these areas helps highlight where services are lacking and can support efforts to improve access and promote health equity.## Data Sources | Dataset | Description | Source ||---------|-------------|--------|| `DCtl_2024_11_tract.zip` | DC Census Tracts (Boundary Shapefiles) | [DC Boundary Shapefile](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2024&layergroup=Census+Tracts) || `Pharmacy_Locations.zip` | Location of DC Pharmacies | [Open Data DC: Pharmacy Locations](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::pharmacy-locations/about) || `Neighborhood_Clusters.zip` | DC Neighborhood Boundaries | [Open Data DC: Neighborhood Clusters Boundaries](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::neighborhood-clusters/about) | ## Script Descriptions and Run OrderRun the scripts in this order: 1. **`01_DCMap.py`**     Loads DC Map shapefiles, reprojects them, and saves to GeoPackage for reuse.1. **`02_PharmacyDCMap.py`**     Loads pharmacy locations, reprojects to match the base map, and saves to GeoPackage.1. **`03_DCMapwithNeighborhoods.py`**     Adds neighborhood cluster boundaries to the map to contextualize DC neighborhood clusters.1. **`04_PharmacyBuffers.py`**     Creates one mile buffer zones around each pharmacy and visualizes overlap.   ## Output Maps Each script produces maps stored as .png images in the Map Images Folder- `WashingtonDCMap.png`- `DCMapwithPharmacyLocations.png`- `DCMapwithPharmaciesandNeighborhoodBoundaries.png`- `DCMapwithPharmacyBuffers.png`## Using QGIS to Improve Map QGIS was used to build on the Python generated maps by adding neighborhood labels, improving the color scheme, and creating Voronoi polygons. These additions made the maps easier to interpret and added geographic context. The Voronoi polygons offered a different perspective on proximity based access, even though it does not align with the one mile buffer definition of pharmacy deserts. QGIS also allowed for a clearer representation of overlapping zones. ## Analysis ![Map with One Mile Buffers Around Pharmacies](QGIS/PharmBuffers.png) This buffer map shows where people in DC have nearby access to pharmacies using a one mile buffer zone. Darker purple areas show where multiple buffers overlap, mostly in neighborhoods with higher business activity like Columbia Heights, Dupont Circle, and Downtown. These parts of the city are well served. On the other hand, areas on the outskirts, especially east of the Anacostia River in neighborhoods like Deanwood, Fort Dupont, and Kenilworth, are lighter or completely unshaded. These locations represent potential pharmacy deserts where residents have limited access to nearby pharmacy services. ![Map with Voronoi Polygons](QGIS/VoronoiPolygons.png)This Voronoi map breaks up DC into zones where each area is closest to one specific pharmacy. The green lines form polygons around the yellow dots representing pharmacy locations. Every point inside a polygon is closest to the pharmacy at its center. In parts of central DC, especially near areas like Downtown, the polygons are small and tightly packed, showing that pharmacies are close together and residents likely have more options nearby. In contrast, neighborhoods like Congress Heights have much larger polygons, which means those pharmacies are more isolated and serve bigger areas. Compared to the buffer map, the Voronoi map can be a less visually comprehensive approach to analyzing pharmacy deserts, and the analysis does not necessarily abide by the one mile buffer defined as pharmacy deserts. However, they help show how spread out service areas are and which neighborhoods are only close to one pharmacy.## Potential to Expand on Analysis Moving forward, this analysis can serve as a foundation for further research. One way to build on it is by bringing in demographic data such as race, income, and age to understand better who does and does not have access to pharmacies. It could also be helpful to look at public transportation, such as WMATA Metro and bus routes, to see if being close to transit helps fill service gaps in underserved areas. If pharmacy data is available across multiple years, it is also possible to explore how major events like the COVID-19 pandemic shaped pharmacy access over time. Finally, it is important to highlight that this approach is not limited to Washington, DC; it can be replicated for any city or region by changing local shapefiles and data.## Band-Aid Solutions Band-aid solutions are not permanent fixes for pharmacy deserts, but they can help meet immediate needs in the short term. Sharing options like mobile pharmacies or delivery services can bring attention to access gaps and offer some relief. These services can be location-specific, so raising awareness about them can be especially important.At the same time, it is essential to be nuanced. Highlighting temporary fixes can sometimes give the impression that enough solutions already exist or that the creation and overreliance on these temporary fixes are a reason for pharmacies' closing. Meaningful change to address pharmacy deserts can be twofold: bringing awareness to band-aid solutions while also analyzing and promoting long-term solutions in the form of urban planning, funding, and the building of infrastructure to make pharmacy access more equitable and sustainable.Examples of Band-Aid Solutions in the DC Region - [CaryRx](https://www.caryrx.com)- [Pill Plus Pharmacy](https://www.pillpluspharmacy.com/mobile)## Summary- The one mile buffer map highlights strong pharmacy access in central DC and showcases potential pharmacy deserts in areas like Deanwood and Fort Dupont.- The Voronoi map shows that pharmacies are densely clustered Downtown but more isolated in the outer neighborhoods, especially east of the Anacostia River.- The maps reveal uneven access across DC, with central areas well served and outer neighborhoods underserved.- These underserved areas could benefit from "band-aid" solutions and public health interventions to improve pharmacy access.
